# Roadmap

## Bugs:
* Sometimes a player cell is displayed with no population (player bg color and no label).

## Feats:
* More control over actions:
    - ~Select origin~
    - ~Select target (could be player cell, to move pops)~
    - ~Control the number of moved pops~
    - Avoid multiple actions on same cell
* Moving restriction
* 2 players
* Better NPC AI

## Minor improvements, optimizations & refactors:
* Style advance button.
* Is possible to merge NPC and player? Some actions seems reusable.

## Infra:
* Babel + es6
* ~Bundle & minify (webpack?)~
* Unit tests

# Roadmap

## Bugs:
* Sometimes a player cell is displayed with no population (player bg color and no label).

## Feats:
* More control over actions:
    - Select origin
    - Select target (could be player cell, to move pops)
    - Control the number of moved pops
    - Avoid multiple actions on same cell

## Minor improvements:
* Style advance button.
